Delays are a major challenge of flight scheduling and airport management. Although some state
and federal governments have invested significant efforts to improve airport infrastructure,
most travelers still cannot avoid disruptions to their itineraries. In 2015, more than 1 in 3 
of flights (Fig. 1) were delayed. A multitude of unpredictable factors (not exhaustive) such 
as weather and mechanical breakdowns make it harder for airport managers to predict which flights
will likely be delayed. However, it may be possible to identify some top causes of delays (e.g.
upstream flight delays) from mining a large 2015 flights dataset for insights. We plan to investigate 
the flights' metadata such as airline, region, airport size, season, day, week and time of departure
to build models to predict which flights are likely to be delayed. The conclusions will be useful for
helping an FAA regulator devise an early warning system to help airlines proactively avoid delays.
